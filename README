I believe most of the functionality is working correctly besides grouping the strings together in a node that begin with the same letter.

The sample file I am reading in from is called list.sp2021, which contains similar strings to the ones used in example.
You could put your own file in there to test the invocations:
./P0 < yourfile
./P0 yourfile
or test keyboard input
./P0

All invocations should work correctly.

command: make
This will compile P0.c

command: make clean 
This will get rid of object files, and also all files with extensions .inorder, .postorder, .preorder
So it cleans up all of the output files and leave my one sample list.sp2021 alone
